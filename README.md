# 🧩 Client Dashboard for IT Companies - SuPrathon 2K25 Submission

This project is a full-stack web application that enables IT companies to seamlessly manage client event submissions through a structured dashboard system. Built in 36 hours during the SuPrathon 2K25 national-level hackathon.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

IT companies receive numerous event requests from clients (webinars, seminars, etc.) and struggle with manual tracking, approvals, and communication. There’s a lack of a central, transparent, and automated system for this.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We built an end-to-end platform where:
- Clients can submit event requests.
- Admins can approve or reject them.
- Status of each event is shown clearly.
- Providers can post events.
- A clean dashboard UI keeps everyone informed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS), Vanilla JS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
**Database:** JSON file (for demo), can be scaled to MongoDB  
**Hosting:** GitHub Pages (Frontend), Render (Backend)
